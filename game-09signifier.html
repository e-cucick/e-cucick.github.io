							<p>This eerie, psychological game was developed by Playmestudio. Together with VRMonkey, we ported it to VR.<br>
							Because the game discusses deeply the relationship between virtual and physical, and has a lot of mechanics rooted on that, porting it to VR was an extra responsibility.

							<p><h3>My responsibilities were the following:</h3><br>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>VR UX Guidelines </strong>, to guarantee the same basic functions.  <strong>Transpose the much needed player UI </strong> when investigating Memories, object interactions, inventory and dialogue 
									<li><strong>Translating mechanics for VR. </strong> Many of the game mechanics assume a player that is standing still and clicking while an animation plays. Changes had to be designed so that the game became more tactile-based.
									<li><strong>Solving incompatibility issues</strong>, such as puzzles or rooms that were not designed with VR in mind, and wouldnâ€™t work in this context.
									<li><strong>Creating new mechanics to get the most out of VR,</strong> especially when investigating visuals or noises, or interacting with Memories.
								</ul>

								I worked with other designers until my departure from the project. <br>
								Mostly <strong>David Fenner </strong>, the original designer for The Signifier. <br>
								I also had  <strong>Victor Valdo </strong> as a Designer on my team.
