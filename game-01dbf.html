							<p>My responsabilities in this amazing, huge project changed over 4 distinct moments, as we made updates for a game already released: </p>
							<br>
							<h2>Airport Update</h2>
							<p><strong>Game Designer</strong></p>
							<span class="image right"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt=""></span>
							<p>Released May, 2022</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Level Design:</strong> sketches, prototypes, whitebox, NPC and Item placement, refining with playtest</li>
								<li><strong>Design Guidelines</strong> - sketches, 3D models, physical objects - for the artists, sound designers and writers to use as reference for items, level elements, NPCs</li>
								<li><strong>Conducting brainstorms</strong> and other collective intelligence methods</li>
								<li><strong>Mechanic design for over 40 items</strong> with unique mechanics. <br> This included implementing and testing it on engine with a unique <strong>Modular Component system</strong>, done for the game</li>
								<li><strong>Design of the Modular Component System</strong> together with Engineering and Production department, enabling quicker Item implementation and emergent behaviours, <strong>turning the game in a sort of Immersive Sim</strong></li>
								<li>Conducting and responding to <strong>playtest</strong></li>
								<li>Complete <strong>rework of the game’s UI</strong></li>
								<li>Redesign of NPC spawn system
									<li>The game got <strong>#2 on Oculus Top Selling</strong> after this update for 3 weeks straight, and kept on top 10. <strong>It’s still on Top Selling</strong></li>
									<li>In media: VIDEO OF THE GUYS PLAYING</li>
								
							</ul>


							<br>
							<h2>Police Station Update</h2>
							<p><strong>Lead Game Designer</strong></p>
							<span class="image right"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt=""></span>
							<p>Released August, 2021</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Level Design</strong> based on an existing sketch</li>
								<li>Guidelines - sketches, 3D models and diagrams - for the team</li>
								<li><strong>Mechanic design for items with unique mechanics</strong>. <br>Here we also decided on a more <strong>‘playground’ style</strong>, making the level destructable and giving the players some vandalism toys✨</li>
								<li><strong>This update alone doubled the number of interactions and toys in the game</strong></li>
								<li>Design and test of a <strong>‘boss fight’</strong> mechanics, ‘boss’ design and Finite State Machines. This ended up scrapped.</li>
								<li>Conducting and responding to <strong>playtest</strong></li>
								<li><strong>Redesigning some mechanics</strong>, like losing, replaying, punching</li>
								<li>Design and test of the <strong>4 Player Multiplayer</strong> system
									<li>The game also <strong>became top selling on Quest</strong> by then. It kept uninterruptedly as Top Seller. </li>
									<li>In media: VIDEO OF THE GUYS PLAYING</li>
						</ul>


							<br>
							<h2>Black Friday Update</h2>
							<p><strong>Producer, Creating a Game Design Document</strong></p>
							<span class="image right"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt=""></span>
							<ul>
								<li>As producer, we took the update out of a Development Hell that was looping for a few years, releasing in 6 months</li>
								<li><strong>Redesigned and fixed mechanics</strong>, giving the game a more systemic approach</li>
								<li>The game had no GDD by then. <strong>A full retroactive GDD was made</strong>, cathegorizing every single mechanic, NPC, item. <br>This would later <strong>allow emergent systems</strong> in the game.</li>
							</ul>


							<br><br>								
							<h2>Project Transition</h2>
							<p>Before leaving the studio, I trained the team of Designers that would follow the project, and prepared <strong>some material</strong> for them. This included:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The <strong>Character Customization</strong> system and UX, that allows for a player to update a photo and use it replacing an NPC’s face</li>
								<li>The concept and ruleset for many items of the <strong>Carnival update</strong>, together with a <strong>whitebox</strong> of the Carnival and NPC concepts and dialogues</li>
								<li>A list of <strong>Analytics</strong> that would be useful to implement</li>
							</ul>
