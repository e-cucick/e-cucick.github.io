							<br>The game combines a <strong>modified Match 3/Chain Matching</strong> mechanics with <strong>resource management</strong>, and players learn together <br> with the game’s protagonist about this massive, Europe-sized forest and its culture.
							<br> <br> <em> We created a demo requested by the Amazonas Government on behalf of Suframa, and delivered it in <strong>April/2023.</strong></em><br> 
							
							<p><h3> My responsibilities were the following:</h3></p>
							<ul>
									<li>Create a <strong>singular big system that combines 3 individual mechanics</strong>: Interacting with NPCs, Match 3, Navigation
									<li><strong>Prototype every mechanic</strong>s and screen flow, to understand the relationship between mechanics and its individual elements
									<li><strong>Guidelines for game feel</strong> - specially on positive feedbacks for players - and easy <strong>affordance</strong> for the target audience.;
									<li><strong>Research of the Amazonian Culture</strong>, it’s traditional peoples, history,  fruits, animals and places, and <strong>teaching it through play.</strong>
									<li><strong>Conducting playtest</strong> and feedback loop;
									<li>Balancing;

							</ul> 

							<p><h3> This project also gave chance to improve some aspects of the general studio pipeline:</h3></p>	
							<ul>
									
								<li>With the Engineering Team, I designed and we developed a <strong>custom system of Analytics</strong>
								<li>Also with the Engineering Team, we developed a <strong>Level Design tool, unique for the game,that aided on a tool-oriented Design culture.</strong>
								<li>Together with 2 designers, we compiled a <strong>Playtest Pipeline</strong> to extract the most data out of playtests
							</ul>

									<p>Although I was given the role of design lead on this project, I had 2 partner Designers on this project:<br>
									<strong>Graziele Mendonça</strong>, who was the original Designer and did all the groundwork!<br>
									<strong>Vitor Jun</strong>, who worked together with me on many of the responsabilities.

							<h2> A personal letter to you</h2><br>
						<em>Working on Amazon Quest was a process of decolonization that I wish other designers could have the luck of going through.<br>
									</strong>This is the game that changed me the most, and I feel it would be crazy not to leave here a mixture of love letter and request to you.<br>
									<strong>I’ve did some personal studies about the very elusive Rondon-Roosevelt</strong> expedition that inspired the game, in which the american president <strong>Theodore Roosevelt</strong> explored the River of Doubt with brazilian indigenist <strong>Candido Rondon</strong>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s7CzzBdKwpCLKWmeo5LnMLJk1XQk-6l_Oem-dtycmjQ/edit?usp=sharing"><strong>you can find it here</strong>.</a>  <br><br> <strong>Knowing about this story may give you a sense of scale of how incredibly big the Amazon Rainforest is.</strong><br>
									I also met a lot of people online, from locations that would show up in game, so I could understand what they’d like to see represented on their towns. <br>This got me affectively involved with the communities, and <strong>introduced me to pro-indigenous activism - specially on the Acampamento Terra Livre</strong> and I learned the history of pre-colonial Brazil.
									<br>Stories and a struggle that has been here all along, but <strong>just like the Rondon-Roosevelt expedition,<br> went barely seen and felt for people outside of the process.</strong>
									<br><br>I won’t be the one lecturing you on this stuff, but I’ll <strong>recommend you hearing the amazing Txai Surui on it!</strong>
