							<p>Fabricas de Cultura (Culture Factory, in a rough translation) is a project from brazilian organization <strong>POIESIS</strong>.
								<br>They build structures on vulnerable communities to empower them with access to culture and skills.
								<br>They have a wide variety of subjects to teach: from music and theatre to game development.
								<br>
								<br>
								I taught in some units </trong>(Jardim São Luís, Brasilandia, Vila Nova Cachoeirinha, Diadema)</strong> and worked closely with the amazing <strong>people who keep this project working</strong> even if they have
								to juggle chainsaws (metaphorically. Only sometimes it's literally.) and the incredible, <strong>incredible students who go there even on saturday mornings, no skipping,</strong>
								and are always eager to bring new things from their repertories and build new things with what they know.
								<br>
								<br>
								Every workshop lasts 6 months, and happens once a week.
								<br>
								<h2>How the class are conducted:</h2>
								<br>
								<h4>Analog Game and Design Thinking</h4>
								<!--  <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								In the <strong>first few classes</strong>, we do some sessions of Game Design Theory, with a lot of practical exercises.
								<br>
								<br>Students are incentivized to see how their work improves with <strong>iteration and theory</strong>, and how their games actually become better as
								they have a broader game Design vocabulary, Design Thinking techniques, and respond to playtest.
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h4>GDevelop and other engines</h4>
								<!--  <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<strong>Usually after 3 classes</strong> and a lot of post-it notes thrown out, <strong>we start on GDevelop</strong>.
								<br>
								<br>I found this to be very useful, as the browser based, and  no-coding system teaches a lot about programming logic without the actual syntax.
								<br><strong>Here we produce a 2D platformer game</strong> with a checklist of mechanics, but in every class students are encouraged to experiment with
								what they know, and <strong>the individual end results always diverge a lot and become very novel</strong>.
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h4>Unity</h4>
								<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<strong>After the 2D game is finished, we start experimenting with an industry-standard engine and we create a 3D game.</strong>
								<br>
								<br>They feel how it is to play on the interface, 
								make simple projects with Unity Primitives, then go to a <strong>1st person project</strong>.
								<br>Each 2 students create their own ‘survival island’, also with a checklist of mechanics.
								<br>
								<br>
								By this point on the workshop, students are also understanding what they are individually good at, so they start <strong>putting their
								their creations on each other’s projects.</strong> It’s not uncommon for a student to create a song, a 3D model, or a specific script for example,
								to another of their peer’s projects.
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h4>Online Groups</h4>
								<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<strong>I keep some online groups to keep class notes.</strong>
								<br>
								They do become hubs of technobabble and game development shitposting for students at some point,
								<br>but students eventually turn to <strong>organize participation on game jams, share their code, designs and arts.</strong>
								<br>
								<br>
								(The memes are pretty good tho)
								
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h4>Personal Journey</h4>
								<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<strong>Each student selects, in the few first classes, a “Personal Journey”.</strong> This is a specific area of game development they’d like to understand more.
								<br>I then bring material every week that friends from the industry point me towards.
								<br>They progress on their free times, and some cool stuff already happened with Personal Journeys:
								<br>
								<br>
								<ul>
									<li>Personal projects</li>
									<li>Game Jam participation</li>
									<li>Cross-projects between students or other courses</li> 
								</ul>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								
								<h4>Thunder Challenge</h4>
								<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								In this system, <strong>every student chooses a class (Warrior, Healer, Mage) with specific skills they can use</strong> on themselves or each other.
								<br>
								<br>"Skills" are things like: leaving the classroom, using Google or getting clues on their Class Challenges.
								<br>
								<br>
							<strong>They get their XP points and level up for doing things like:</strong>
								<ul> 
									<li>Answering correctly my questions, helping someone on their answer - or <strong>asking their own questions</strong></li>
									<li><strong>Helping their fellow students</strong> with Skills or on their projects</li>
									<li><strong>Delivering</strong> cool projects, designs or implementations</li>
									<li><strong>Correcting mistakes from my lectures</strong></li>
									<li><strong>Engaging on a Personal Journey</strong>, and advancing n their Personal Journey</li>
								</ul>
								This enhances class engagement and keeps students from the temptation of mindlessly browsing the internet on their computers.

								<br>I borrowed the name from my university professor <strong>Ricardo Troula</strong>, who had a similar system on our classes. Thanks, Troula!
